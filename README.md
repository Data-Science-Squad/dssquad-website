This repo is the source of the development and production versions of the DS-Squad project website. 

The website is built with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/hugo.html) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) via continuous deployment. Netlify automatically deploys the development site from the `develop` branch and the production site from the `main` branch.
